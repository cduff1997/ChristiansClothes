# ChristiansClothes Week 14. Added NuGet packages via the tools menu in visual studio. Used the package manager (or console) to install Microsoft Entity Framework SQL Server & Tools. Changed the contact model class to include a primary key called ContactId. Did the same for the product model class.
# Called the product model key ProductId. Added a new folder to my project called Data, in this I created a context class for my project, called ChristiansClothesContext.cs. Changed the name of the DbContext class to reflect my project name instead of JesseSoundVibes. Added connection strings
# to my appsettings.json file. Added code to my Program.cs file to enable dependency injection. Added directives to use Microsft Entity Framework core as well. Added links to my navbar for ProductDb and ContactDb. Used scaffolding tools to produce CRUD pages for my product model and contact model.
# Migrated and updated my database after this was finished. Then I changed some lines in my ContactModels index file, and my ProductModels index file. I added 4 new contacts to my ContactDb table in my database. I changed lines in the Product Models Index, Details, and Delete files to be able to
# show my images in the ProductDb page. I then was able to add all 6 of my Products to the ProductDb. Overall I had to update some old parts of my code that weren't working properly as well, I believe I had a redundancy in my ProductModel class that wasn't allowing me to properly create the
# database at first, hence why I specified keys in the context file. I was trying to troubleshoot my problem. Finally cleaned that up and got it working as expected.
