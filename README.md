# In my ASP.NET Web programming class, I learned quite a bit. One of the things I learned was how to use Razor syntax is ASP.NET views, which allows for seamless integration of server-side code with HTML markup. This allowed me to generate dynamic content and present data in a clean and efficient
# manner. I also learned about MVC (Model-View-Controller) Architecture. My web application used this to separate the model (data), view (presentation), and controller (app logic) to provide a structured approach to building my web application. A third thing that I learned in my programming class
# was how to implement a varied design into my web app that still felt responsive and enjoyable to consumers, using CSS to enhance the visual presentation of my web pages. Three things that I think can be included in my web application to help improve it would be as follows:
# User Authentication and Authorization. Doing this would implement a secure system to verify user identities and control access to specific features based on user roles. Responsive Design. Enhancing the user experience by implementing a responsive design that ensures the application is accessible
# and user friendly across various devices and screen sizes. Third, Real-time Updates with SignalR. SignalR being implemented would enable the web app to deliver real-time communication between the server and clients, allowing for instant updates and notifications within the application.
# In my site.css, I included some more code to help with responsive design. I already had some in there to adjust font depending on screen size, adjust image size, etc. I also included some comments with the code to explain what I changed. In short, layout adjustments, image and media queries,
# and navigation bar adjustments for smaller screens. This is all included in my wwwroot/css/site.css file. Style changes I made: In my wwwroot/css/site.css file, I included a few style changes after my responsive design, with comments. Changed the button style of my FAQ buttons, improved the
# typography of my site with a different font family, and changed to a different color scheme to enhance readability. In my views/shared/_Layout.cshtml file, I updated my navbar for enhanced readability and responsiveness by simplifying the layout and alignment on the page, and removing some
# unnecessary classes. Also, finally corrected my Home Page png file showing on every page by adding a ViewBag variable in the Index action to indicate whether the current action is for the home page, this is in controllers/HomeController.cs. Then, updated the body section of 
# views/shared/_Layout.cshtml to check the value of ViewBag.IsHomePage and conditionally included the image. These changes made it so my ChristiansClothes.png image is only shown on the Home page and not every other page, it looks much better!
