# ChristiansClothes Week 11. Added data validation to ContactModel and ProductModel in the form of FirstName, LastName, Phone, Email, Address, Message, ProductName, ProductDescription, ProductImage, and ProductPrice. Added a link to an Events page for my web app. It is located after the Tools link
# and is part of the home controller. Added a view for the Events page that includes a title for upcoming events, a heading, four events that a retail web app would sponsor, a description and title for each of those events, an age group recommended for each event, a location for the events,
# and a date and time for the events. I also included a way to register for the events, simply using the name of my web app.com. (christiansclothes.com). I styled the events using the bootstrap card feature and made sure to have the necessary bootstrap files in my _Layout.cshtml file. I included
# an action method in the home controller that will display the Events page view as well. Tested the app and everything seems to be working how it should!
